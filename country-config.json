			"total_visitation": "Mapped estimates of the annual tourism and recreation visitation numbers directly attributable to the presence of coral reefs in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Reef areas in St. Vincent and the Grenadines with a modelled visitation value exceeding zero have been split into deciles. The top decile (10% of reefs with tourism value) represents reefs registering in our models as having an annual value of over 850,000 visitor equivalents per square kilometre, and the bottom decile (lowest 10%) are still registering values of up to 152,000 visitor equivalents per square kilometre. These values are taken from the combined value of on reef values and reef adjacent values, the former including recreational diving and snorkelling and the latter including the provision of calm waters, coral sand beaches, views and seafood.",
			"reef_highest_value": "Map highlighting the reefs estimated to have the highest annual dollar values in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. This map depicts the 10% of reef areas (top decile) in St. Vincent and the Grenadines with the highest values (>$432,000 per square kilometre) in red, with the remainder of the reefs in gray."
